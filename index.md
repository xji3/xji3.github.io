# Welcome!


I am an Assistant Professor in the Math Department at Tulane University.
I work on statistical phylogenetics, from model development to practical parallel computing library implementation.  An old research statement (with some of the items already published) discusses this research direction in more detail in the [Research](./Publication/index.html) tab.
